for exclusive or common use, without distinction.£
These Regulations are available to clients at the hotel reception and they may
consult them whenever they wish. Additionally, these Regulations are available on the
hotel’s website.£
Ignorance of these Regulations is no defence for non-compliance, as these
Regulations are based on current laws and legislation.£
These Regulations will be in continuous and uninterrupted effect until they are

satisfactory in all its rules and regulations.£

Infringements of these Regulations, to the extent possible, will be corrected
immediately and, if appropriate, may be punished in accordance with labour, civil or
criminal legislation, irrespective of other responsibilities that the offender may incur and
the appropriate legal action to which they are entitled.£
The Hotel reserves the right of admission and to cancel the reservation, without
right to refund, of any client who contravenes these Regulations, as well as the rules of
living and common sense, or acts in any way disrespectfully to the Hotel facilities or other
people within it, be they staff or guests of the Hotel.£
We appreciate your choice to stay with us, as well as your strict observance of our
Regulations, prepared for your own benefit.£
In any case, should you require additional information please do not hesitate to
contact Reception. To this end, we remind you that the Hotel Manager, together with
the reception staff and, where appropriate, the concierge, are the main contact or
central relationship for guests of the hotel establishment, and for information and advice
of the same.£
The Internal Regimen Regulation is governed by Spanish law.£
This Regulation is available in different languages, but only the text in Spanish is
the sole legally binding text, and the one that will prevail if there is any difference of
interpretation or any other nature.£
Reception is where the necessary steps are taken for registration and admission,
and where the magnetic cards are kept to access accommodation.£
Check-in takes place from 14:00 and until 20:00 on the day of the client's arrival,
and Check-out until 12.00 pm on the day of departure.£
If the guest arrives before Check-in time and the Hotel has rooms available, they
can enter as early as 7:00.£
In the event that, for personal reasons, the guest has to register their arrival after
20:00, they should notify the hotel 24 hours prior to their arrival.£
The Hotel will abstain from providing accommodation to minors who arrive alone,
nor do we accept bookings of rooms or stays by minors.£
However, minors between the ages of 16 to 18 years old may be authorised in
writing by the father, mother or guardian to stay at the Hotel as long as they are the ones
to take responsibility of the minor and assume the payment of the bill as appropriate. In
the case of minors under the age of 16 years, they must also always be accompanied
by the father, mother or guardian.£
The person or persons who wish to make use of the accommodation units,
common facilities and, where appropriate, complementary services offered by the
Hotel, must present their identification documents on registration and sign in to the Hotel
Register of the establishment.£
When guests arrive as a pre-booked group (group bookings are considered
reservations of 10 or more rooms), their representative will hand over the lists together
with the identification documents of the group members.£
Valid identification in Spain are passports, DNI and Driver's License. If you are a
foreigner you can register by presenting a Passport or Identity Card if you come from an
EU country or any of the following countries:£
  Andorra, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway, Malta, Monaco or San Marino.
You can also register with a current Spanish Residency Permit if you are a foreign
resident in Spain.£
This rule is mandatory in accordance with the Order of the Ministry of the Interior
of the Government of Spain 1922/2.003 of 3 July, which requires registration and entry
records for Travellers in a Hotel Establishment, Royal Decree 933/2021 of October 26 and
under the provisions of article 12.1 of Organic Law 1/1992, of February 21, on the
Protection of Citizen Security.£
In compliance with the above, all guests, both individuals and guests, must have
an individual registration sheet.£
The registration sheet must be personally signed by all travellers over the age of
14 years.£
The accommodation is non-transferable, meaning that the Hotel will deny
accommodation to any guest who does not comply with this registration requirement
and has the power to demand, if it deems it appropriate, the identification of the
applicant and the people accompanying them in the hotel. Any person not registered
in the police register are also prohibited from entering the Hotel, unless with the direct
permission of the Management.£
The Hotel Management is not responsible for any false or incomplete information
that the guest may provide when filling out the registration card, whose details should be
filled out by the user in full, or by the Hotel based on the details that appear on the
identification documents provided to such effects by the client.£
In compliance with current legislations, the identification data supplied shall be
communicated to the authorities by the Hotel.£
This establishment, once a person or persons have been registered, will prepare
an admission document stating the name of the client in order to formalise the admission
(featuring a person, the commercial name of the establishment, the tourist classification,
the identification of the allocated accommodation, price per day, the category and
price of complementary services provided, and dates of check-in and check-out).£
Users must provide proof of their condition, producing the admission document,
when required.£
The admission sheet provides proof of the tourist accommodation contract and
will serve as proof for administrative purposes, and therefore must be signed by the
concerned party to formalise their admission.£
The original signed document shall remain in the possession of the establishment,
who will retain it for the time stipulated by law to be made available for tourist inspection,
providing a copy to the guest who signed the same.£
By signing the document, the client confirms that all the data provided are true
and accepts the terms and conditions expressed in the document.£
Signing the document also assumes that the Client expressly accepts these
Regulations, its rights and obligations, and shall be bound to observe the rules contained
in the same and those dictated by Management on security, coexistence and hygiene
for the proper use of the establishment, its facilities and the equipment of the Hotel.£
Users may freely access the establishment and stay in the same, within the
limitations contained in legislation and in these Regulations.£
Users have the right to receive full and accurate information, and for such
information to be provided prior to the contracting of services offered.£
In addition, guests have the right to security, privacy and total peace-of-mind
during their stay, in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. Invoices for any
services contracted directly to the hotel will be issued to in accordance with the current
regulations of the Data Protection Act concerning maintaining the confidentiality of any
personal information. In the event of a guest wishing to make a complaint, forms
provided by the relevant authoritative department(s) from the corresponding
Autonomous Community (region) must be filled out by the guest and handed in at the
hotel reception.£
The submission of any claim or complaint does not exempt the client from the
observance of these Regulations or the payment of services.£
The hotel is not responsible for the price, nor the use of tools, utensils and other
services provided outside the hotel establishment, nor the behaviour of any outside staff,
unless expressly reflected in their conditions and rates.£
Rates with the prices and conditions of the different modes of accommodation,
catering, bars, safe rental, and complementary services offered by the Hotel are detailed
in reception for users who request them.£
It is not possible to reserve services of the establishment or accommodation units
against the stipulated price.£
Complementary services that are offered and are provided in this establishment
by other persons or entities, the detail of their scheduled times, their prices and conditions
of use, also found at reception, will be formalised in their corresponding documents and
settled in accordance with the conditions agreed.£
Legal entities or individuals who, on their own basis, provide complementary
services in different areas of the hotel, are responsible for their own staff and their
behaviour, operation, maintenance, prices and everything inherent in their own services.
Each of the different units clearly identifies the holder of the same.£
For all of the services and activities, where appropriate, you will find a summary of
information in directories, which include information about the evacuation plan in case
of emergency, accommodation prices, menus with their prices, and communication of
free services, such as Wi-Fi.£
In any case, the Hotel can offer to their clients, at no additional cost, extra services
such as tourist information, wake up service, storage of valuables in the Hotel's general
safe, provided that their contents is declared and signed for by the customer, storage of
baggage, and taxi calling service.£
The Hotel is also able to manage certain services beyond the establishment, such
as car rental, excursions, restaurants, and other services related to the stay.£
The Hotel may vary the timetables for different services of consumption, use and
enjoyment, throughout the seasons, depending on the seasonality, and reserves the right
not to admit users outside these hours, or when the maximum authorised capacity is
exceeded or admission is limited, thereby damaging the work schedules of such services.
Guests’ permission will be sought prior to taking any messages, phone calls,
packages or anything addressed to them on their behalf. In the event that the guest
cannot be located within the hotel, staff will ensure that the message or package is
verified with the guest upon their return and delivered to them appropriately.£
The rooms and common spaces of the hotel may not be used for uses other than
accommodation and/or hired services, either by the guest or his/her companions, or by
third parties. Consequently, the aforementioned rooms and/or common spaces may not
be used for activities such as conducting interviews, filming, taking pictures for
promotional activities, photo sessions, etc., unless previously and expressly authorized by
the Management of the establishment and always complying with the rest of Internal
Regulations, the conditions set by the aforementioned Management and the regulations
that apply to the activity in question.£
The billing of accommodation rates will be computed per day and in accordance
with the number of overnight stays.£
The minimum billing for accommodation will be at the rate of one overnight or
day, with the understanding that this ends at 12:00 the day after the date of entry.
Payment methods accepted by the Hotel are the following: Cash, Debit cards
(Maestro) and Credit cards (Master Card, Visa, Amex, American Express and Diners).£
Personal cheques are not accepted.£
When payment is made in cash, this must be done in euros.£
The payment may not exceed the amount of 1,000 euros and, given that the rights
must be exercised in accordance with the requirements of good faith, bills must be used
that are appropriate to the amount to pay, meaning that the Hotel reserves the right to
refuse high denomination bills if the amount to be paid is much lower.£
Payments with more than 50 coins of euros will also not be accepted.£
Users are obligated to pay the amount of contracted services when presented
with the bill or in accordance with the agreed terms.£
Any food or other goods found in the Hotel room (for example the contents of the
minibar, towel, bathrobe), which you consume or take with you when leaving the room
will be charged the equivalent amount as shown on the price list available in each room
or in the Hotel reception.£
In the event that a Client leaves their room and said food or goods are not found
in the room, it shall be deemed that these were consumed or taken by the client.£
The bill can be presented by the Hotel before the end of the stay if during this
period the services enjoyed (either accommodation, extras or both) meet or exceed the
sum of 600 euros.£
The establishment may require its clients, at any time and after the presentation
of the bill and its receipt, to pay for of services provided outside the accommodation,
even when the payment for this had been agreed in advance.£
The departure of the client before the end of the contracted stay shall not exempt
the client from paying the full amount for all reserved days and contracted services.
If a client intends to leave the establishment with a wholly or partially unpaid bill,
the Hotel will be entitled to request the assistance of the authorities.£
The Hotel can request advance of payment by credit card for the contracted
services, in accordance with the applicable law, of both the full amount of the
reservation including taxes and tourist tax that may apply, as well as for extras.£
This guarantee may be extended to damages or malfunctions that occur in the
fixtures, furniture or other elements of the establishment due to negligence or misuse.£
To such effects, the Hotel can ask the client on arrival, or when making their
reservation, for a credit card number where, in the case of non-payment of a bill, they
can be charged for the same.£
Such a request may be made even for accommodation that is pre-paid or
comped, to ensure payment for extra services that may be used, as well as to cover
damages and malfunctions.£
The Hotel reserves the right, in the event of any damages, malfunction or theft in
the room or any other area of the hotel by the customer, to use the breakage deposit
and/or claim this compensation.£
The Hotel will also be able to use the client’s credit card number to charge or
preauthorise the amount of the first night contracted, even days before the client's
arrival, in order to verify the validity of the card.£
If a card cannot be provided, prepayment for the stay and a security deposit of
500 euros will be required, as well as upfront payment for any extra services requested.
Hotel rooms should be used based on the number of nights booked.£
Occupation of an accommodation unit begins at 12:00 noon on the first day of
the contracted period and ends at 12:00 noon on the day indicated as the date of
departure.£
However, on dates of maximum occupancy, when there is a higher number of
check-ins and check-outs, it is possible that not all rooms will be available at this schedule
due to reasons of availability and cleaning times, which can lead to a delay of up to four
hours in making the accommodation unit available to the user.£
Availability may also be delayed in the case of exceptional circumstances which
prevent, for reasons beyond the Hotel’s capabilities, having the room for the
corresponding guest at the time fixed for the beginning of the occupation under the
normal rules of occupation.£
We ask that the guest communicates their time of arrival and travel plans to
enable the Hotel to prepare, and also remember that if you do not arrive at the hotel by
20:00 hours (local time) on the day of your arrival, without prior communication from the
guest, the Hotel will consider the reservation as a “no show” and it will be fully cancelled
automatically, charging 100% or the outstanding amount of the reservation.£
However, the reservation will be kept as long as the client has communicated their
arrival before the time mentioned above.£
In the case of groups of 20 or more persons, the establishment may set the
departure time from 10 in the morning.£
For possible changes, both in occupation as well as an extension of the time
indicated, please ask at reception, keeping in mind that you must immediately inform
Hotel staff should you want to prolong your stay, and always before 12 noon of the
departure date.£
The Hotel will honour your request as long as availability permits, duly informing the
guest who requested it, and in the case of agreement between the parties, they may
agree to a new occupancy status of the accommodation units, which should be
reflected in the admission document.£
Any extension of the time of occupation to that described, without prior
agreement, will result in the obligation to pay for one day more.£
Notwithstanding the above, the client will not be able to extend, without
agreement from the Hotel, the contracted number of days of stay, due to the serious
damage that this could cause for other clients with reservations. The Hotel staff has the
power to request help from the authority to evict clients who fail to comply with the
above.£
In the event that the client leaves the room on the day of departure prior to the
time set for the Check-Out, there will be no refund for the total amount of the stay. If the
client reduces, in whole or in part, the number of guests on the reservation, it is the Hotel's
decision whether or not to grant a refund, though in the case that the room has been
indicated as non-refundable or similar, there will be a charge of the full amount of the
booking.£
When guests are absent for more than seventy-two hours without prior notice, the
Hotel may deem the contract of accommodation to be suspended or terminated, and
proceed to collect the luggage in accordance with article 18 of these Regulations,
except in the case in which the actual value of the guest's belongings does not
guarantee the amount of the bill.£
Under these circumstances the Hotel may terminate or suspend the stay with the
absence of the guest for more than twenty-four hours. In the event of the death of the
occupant of a room, their heirs or representatives will be responsible for paying the
resulting costs, including if necessary the redecoration and disinfection of the room and
the replacement of linens and equipment.£
As a general rule, persons who exceed the contracted room capacity are not
permitted to stay.£
Consequently, two people will not be permitted to stay in a double room that has
been contracted as a single. Similarly, no more than two people will be allowed to stay
in a double room or suite, nor more than three in a room booked as a triple.£
For safety reasons a maximum of four people are allowed to a room, or where
appropriate, the maximum number according to the room format and type of
reservation.£
Otherwise, the Hotel reserves the right to charge the fixed rate for the actual
number of persons using the room, and at the same time put an immediate end to the
client’s stay.£
Guests staying with infants of 0 to 2 years old may request, subject to availability,
a baby cot at no additional cost. The maximum number of baby cots in a room is one.£
Bedside cots are available on request and must be confirmed by the accommodation.£
One child aged 2 or over or one adult can stay in an extra bed. The use of an
additional or rollaway bed will carry an additional cost and be available only in double
rooms, and always at the request of the individual user. In the event that the bed has not
been requested in advance, the Hotel reserves the right to request an extra reservation
in the event that the establishment does not have the requested extra bed. Such
additional bed can only be occupied by one person, one being the maximum number
of extra beds in the room.£
No person has the right to give accommodation to another without the prior
consent of the hotel, and if this is given, their movements must be recorded in the Hotel
Register.£
The Hotel reserves the right to admit occasional visitors and under no
circumstances will they be allowed access to the rooms. If the user wishes to receive visits,
the Hotel has spaces available for this purpose.£
Should a user fail to comply, the Hotel Management reserves the right to order the
immediate departure of the visitor.£"

will not apply if it is proved that the Hotel did not approve the request.£

special agreement in which payment of the request fee will not be required.£
